# Changelog

All notable changes to aitamer.news. The version lives in `VERSION`; each task is tagged `checkpoint/<VERSION>`.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-09-25

### Added
- Publish times. Every published post now stores a full UTC time in `pubDate` (e.g. `2026-09-23T17:51:26Z`). `npm run stamp` writes it: the time the post first went live according to git, or now for a post published but not yet committed. The frontmatter date always wins; a time on another day falls back to 00:00 UTC and is listed for an editor.
- `npm run check:times` — fails when a published post has a date but no time. Both deploy workflows run it, with `npm test`, before building.
- Article bylines show the publish time in UTC ("Sep 23, 2026, 17:51 UTC"); RSS items carry the time.

### Changed
- The 25 published posts were stamped from git history. Posts published together keep the same time; their order is now fixed by post id instead of being arbitrary.

Baseline. Versioning starts here; everything before it is in `git log` (commits up to `63e4065`).

### Added
- Standard repository files: `VERSION`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `PROGRESS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `PLAN.md`, `HANDOFF.md`, `BACKLOG.md`, `.env.example`, `LICENSE` (all rights reserved).
